1. Call By Value
    - While calling a function, we pass the values of variables to it. Such functions are known as “Call By Values”.

    - In this method, the value of each variable in the calling function is copied into corresponding dummy variables of the called function.

    - With this method, the changes made to the dummy variables in the called function have no effect on the values of actual variables in the calling function

    - In call-by-values, we cannot alter the values of actual variables through function calls.

    - Values of variables are passed by the Simple technique.

    - This method is preferred when we have to pass some small values that should not change.

    - Call by value is considered safer as original data is preserved

2. Call By Refrence
    - While calling a function, instead of passing the values of variables, we pass the address of variables(location of variables) to the function known as “Call By References.

    - In this method, the address of actual variables in the calling function is copied into the dummy variables of the called function.

    - With this method, using addresses we would have access to the actual variables and hence we would be able to manipulate them.

    - In call by reference, we can alter the values of variables through function calls.

    - Pointer variables are necessary to define to store the address values of variables.

    - This method is preferred when we have to pass a large amount of data to the function.

    - Call by reference is risky as it allows direct modification in original data
