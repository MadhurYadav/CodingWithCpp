What is Constructor?
    • Constructor in C++ is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. 

    • Constructor is a member function of a class, whose name is same as the class name.

    • Constructor is a special type of member function that is used to initialize the data members for an object of a class automatically, when an object of the same class is created.

    • Constructor is invoked at the time of object creation. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object that is why it is known as constructor.

    • Constructor do not return value, hence they do not have a return type.


    Constructor can be defined inside the class declaration or outside the class declaration
    a.    Syntax for defining the constructor within the class
            <class-name>(list-of-parameters)
            {
                    //constructor definition
            }
    b.    Syntax for defining the constructor outside the class
            <class-name>: :<class-name>(list-of-parameters)
            {
                    //constructor definition
            }


Characteristics of constructor
    • The name of the constructor is same as its class name.

    • Constructors are mostly declared in the public section of the class though it can be declared in the private section of the class.

    • Constructors do not return values; hence they do not have a return type.

    • A constructor gets called automatically when we create the object of the class.

    • Constructors can be overloaded.

    • Constructor can not be declared virtual.


Types of constructor 
    • Default constructor
    • Parameterized constructor
    • Overloaded constructor
    • Constructor with default value
    • Copy constructor
    • Inline constructor
